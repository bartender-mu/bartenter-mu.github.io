title: Hi, I'm Luke
---

Hey, I'm Luke. I'm a self taught software engineer and high school student. I'm the lead developer of [Spacebin](https://spaceb.in), [Redeyes](https://github.com/lukewhrit/redeyes), and more projects, along with being a recurring contributor to [Eve](https://github.com/ericzty/eve) and [ricky.cat](https://github.com/orca-group/ricky.cat).

I began programming at age 12 and since then I've developed an interest in creating efficient, simplistic software with the goal of creating a better, more helpful internet.
